# Challenge

Review the [requirements](./requirements.md) to see your task.

This challenge will incorporate your knowledge of JavaScript and CSS, as well as your skills navigating existing systems and frameworks.

The goal is to complete everything in the "Project Requirements" specifications.

You have **6 hours** to complete this task. Please stick to this time limit.

#### It is totally okay if you don't finish!

Note: **Do not count** dev environment setup as part of your 6 hour limit. Start the clock once you've gotten everything set up and are able to successfully run the project on your machine. You can of course do this challenge in chunks. As long as your total project time limit does not exceed 6 hours.

## ðŸ™Œ Submitting
